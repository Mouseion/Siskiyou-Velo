<h1>Bicycle Safety Tips!</h1>
<p>Bicycles provide recreation, exercise and personal transportation. But they must be ridden safely with a keen awareness of the cycling environment. Use the tips listed below to help improve your safety and confidence as a bicyclist.</p>

<ul class="safetyTips">
    <li>Obey all traffic signals, signs and lane markings. Cyclists have the same responsibilities and privileges as motor vehicle drivers.</li>
    <li>Purchase and use a bicycle helmet. See <a href="http://www.bhsi.org/guide.htm">http://www.bhsi.org/guide.htm</a> for fitting suggestions.</li>
    <li><strong>Ride</strong> on the right side of the road with the flow of traffic. Car drivers are looking for other cars and truck, not for bikes going in the wrong direction. Pass slower-moving or stopped vehicles on their left except when traveling in a bike lane. </li>
    <li class="doorzone"></li>
    <li><strong>Ride</strong> far enough away from the curb to stay clear of opening car doors, potholes, debris and sewer grates and to maintain a straight line. If the road is too narrow for vehicles to pass you safely, it may be better to ride in the middle of the lane to prevent dangerous overtaking. Practice riding in a straight line. It is an important skill when cycling alone as well as with others.</li>
    <li><strong>Ride</strong> defensively! Be alert: scan the route ahead for traffic, opening car doors, pedestrians, and obstacles on the road surface.</li>
    <li><strong>Ride</strong> predictably so that others can see you and predict your movements.  Do not weave in and out between parked cars. Use hand signals to indicate turns and when slowing.</li>
    <li>Make eye contact with motorists and pedestrians before crossing paths. Motorists sometimes don't watch for or see cyclists. For some vehicle drivers you are invisible.</li>
    <li>Except when signaling, always keep both hands on the handlebars and be ready to brake. Use secure racks or packs for carrying items or packages.</li>
    <li>Go slower and use caution when the road is wet or icy, or when it is foggy or visibility is otherwise limited.</li>
    <li>Be visible; use lights, and reflectors when riding at night. Brightly colored or reflective clothing can help increase visibility.</li>
    <li>Avoid bicycling upon sidewalks, especially in areas where motorists may not expect bicyclists or may have obstructed visibility.</li>
    <li>Keep your bicycle in good working condition. See <a href="http://www.bitrot.de/bbook_intro.html">http://www.bitrot.de/bbook_intro.html</a> Only ride a bicycle that is adjusted and sized to fit you.</li>
