<h1>Siskiyou Velo Education and Skills Training Courses</h1>

<p>The aim of the Club&rsquo;s education and training program is to:</p>

<ul class="classList">
    <li>Improve knowledge and compliance of laws affecting cyclists</li>
    <li>Bolster ride skills of members and the general public</li>
    <li>Increase cyclists' enjoyment and safety on club rides</li>
    <li>Create a better, safer, cycling environment in our Rogue Valley</li>
</ul>

    
<p>The program is funded, in large part, through the Club&rsquo;s Mountain Lakes Challenge, Velo&rsquo;s annual fundraiser.</p>
<p>The courses are tailored to the needs of Club members. In that light, the courses will evolve and change with the needs of the members. Take a look at the current <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1LWbFHCwFTxjxhgdnVM2UgQz-II8xGS61n-2gSVwZrPE">Course Descriptions</a> and complete the  <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dFRhSjdPd2FDdEpfek9Pd0xDZm11WFE6MA">Registration Form</a> to reserve your spot for an upcoming course. Course offerings change so check back for updates.</p>
