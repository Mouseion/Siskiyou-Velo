            <p>The Etna Brewing Co./DeSalvo Cycles Race Team is a team with roots running deep in the Scott Valley of Northern California.  Long renowned as an epic training ground, and a place where climbers such as Bobby Julich have come to train, the Scott Valley has been a perfect base for the team.</p>

            <p>During his recovery from hip replacement surgery in 2002 team founder Scott Davidson thought it a good idea to have some company on his rehab rides.  He sought out former pro and 7-Eleven team directeur sportif Mike Neel, and together they rounded up several other cyclists from the Scott Valley.  The team was formed, and with Reny Townsend, the team got instant results on the mountain bike, and then on the road.</p>

            <p>In 2006, the team merged with the DeSalvo Custom Cycles Elite Race Team, and so now the team's home territory can be described as the entire State of Jefferson: from the Rogue Valley of Southern Oregon to the north, to the Scott Valley to the south.  Still, team members come from as far away as the Bay Area, making Etna Brewing/DeSalvo Cycles a truly regional team.</p>
