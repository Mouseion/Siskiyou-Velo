				<p>Rachel competed in her first triathlon back in 2008. Although she didn’t know how to swim and had sworn she’d never do a triathlon, attending a friend’s race changed her mind, and in only 7 weeks she learned how to swim, started riding a bike again, and finally completed the Black Diamond Tri-It Triathlon, winning her age group.
					<br/>
					<br/>
					Her triathlon career took a two-year hiatus while she focused on college, but in May 2010 she was ready to begin training again. With a newfound focus and dedication, she was back at it. In her first full rookie season, Rachel competed in 4 sprint-distance triathlons, and consistently placed 4th or higher in her age group. At Portland Triathlon, her 4th-ever tri, Rachel qualified for Age Group Nationals. While this was certainly something to be proud of, Rachel is equally proud of her ‘less glamorous’ accomplishments of 2010: mastering road cleats and teaching herself to do flip turns!
					<br/>
					<br/>
					Rachel has decided to continue focusing on sprint-distance races in 2011, to gain both experience and confidence in a less competitive environment. Her race schedule includes many Pacific NW favorites, and in August she will compete in the USAT Sprint Age Group Nationals in Burlington, Vermont. Her goals include a high TriNW Sprint Distance ranking and qualifying for Age Group Sprint Distance Worlds. She looks forward to a fun, demanding season to help prepare her for her Olympic distance debut in 2012.

			<p>First there was a passion for sport. Next was the passion for competing. Last to come a long was our passion for each other!
				<br/>
				<br/>
				Travis started in competing in Triathlons in 2001, and had some reasonable results as a junior in the ITU and Pacific Northwest. However after stepping away from sport for a few years he rekindled his passion in the winter of 2008 when he got on the Etna Brewing and DeSalvo Custom Cycles Cycling Team. Between the 2008 and 2009 race seasons he moved up in category to a Cat 3. His current goal for the 2011 season is to upgrade to a cat 2.
