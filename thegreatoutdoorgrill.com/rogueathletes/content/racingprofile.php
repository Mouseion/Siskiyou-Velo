				<p class="mainRachel">Rachel competed in her first triathlon back in 2008. Although she didn't know how to swim and had sworn she'd never do a triathlon, attending a friend's race changed her mind, and in only 7 weeks she learned how to swim, started riding a bike again, and finally completed the Black Diamond Tri-It Triathlon, winning her age group.
					</p>
                   <p class="mainRachel">
					Her triathlon career took a two-year hiatus while she focused on college, but in May 2010 she was ready to begin training again. With a new-found focus and dedication, she was back at it. In her first full rookie season, Rachel competed in 4 sprint-distance triathlons, and consistently placed 4th or higher in her age group. At Portland Triathlon, her 4th-ever tri, Rachel qualified for Age Group Nationals. While this was certainly something to be proud of, Rachel is equally proud of her 'less glamorous' accomplishments of 2010: mastering road cleats and teaching herself to do flip turns!
					</p>
                   <p class="mainRachel">
					Rachel has decided to continue focusing on sprint-distance races in 2011, to gain both experience and confidence in a less competitive environment. Her race schedule includes many Pacific NW favorites, and in August she will compete in the USAT Sprint Age Group Nationals in Burlington, Vermont. Her goals include a high TriNW Sprint Distance ranking and qualifying for Age Group Sprint Distance Worlds. She looks forward to a fun, demanding season to help prepare her for her Olympic distance debut in 2012.

            <h1>Objective</h1>
            <p class="mainTravis">
            To be part of a highly organized elite team, work towards team results and achievements, and develop in the sport under the leadership and guidance of experienced riders, directors, and coaches.

            <h1>Background</h1>
            <p class="mainTravis">
            In 2000 I began competing in triathlons. I competed for three years and earned a top-three slot in the ITU Pacific Northwest U23 ranking. A hiatus from competing and training has led me to my current athletic passion: cycling.
            </p>
            <p class="mainTravis">
I started cycling again in 2009 as a B-Team rider for Etna Brewing/DeSalvo Custom Cycles. I started the season as a Cat 5 and completed the season as a Cat 4. After recovering from a foot injury in November of 2009 I went on to become an A-Team rider for Etna Brewing/DeSalvo early in the season. I achieved my Cat 3 upgrade mid season and am working towards my Category 2 upgrade.
            </p>
            <p class="mainTravis">
While working with the other Etna Brewing A-Team riders, I developed my racing skills as well as my passion for working hard for team results. I learned that individual results aren't as important as getting the GC rider onto the podium. I also learned to never give up on a race.
            </p>
            <p class="mainTravis">
My strength in cycling is as an all-arounder. I favor stage races, climbing, and long road races. I love long days on the bike with heavy work loads and riding aggressively as a team.
            </p>
