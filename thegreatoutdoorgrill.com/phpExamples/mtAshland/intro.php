<h1>Mount Ashland</h1>
<p>Mount Ashland has it all: lift access, cross-country trails, backcountry powder, and convenience. Located less than 30-minutes from downtown Ashland by car, it's easy to hit the slopes anytime. The lift area boasts 300 acres of great skiing, but in the backcountry the skiing is almost endless. You won't get a lot of vertical feet in one descent, but because the approach is quick and accessible, it's easy to get in a lot of laps on the slopes. If you arrive before the lifts start running you can get a lap in, then yo-yo between the backside and the front side.</p>
