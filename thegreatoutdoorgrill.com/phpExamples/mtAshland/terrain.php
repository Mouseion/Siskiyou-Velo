<p>Mount Ashland offers a variety of terrain including meadows, old growth forest, and steep slopes. The backcountry is located on the south-facing side of the mountain. Snow can become slushy in the backcountry on a warm spring day, but has great powder after a big storm. The front-country portion of the mountain is north-facing and much of the terrain is fairly steep. There's also a "bowl" which has some of the best terrain on the mountain, including an extremely fun tree line runout.</p>
