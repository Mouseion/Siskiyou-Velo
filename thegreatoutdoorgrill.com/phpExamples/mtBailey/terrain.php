<p>Mt. Bailey is a very unique backcountry experience, offering huge untracked steeps from the top. The trail runs northwest through the forest. It's marked for cross-country skiers, and follows the southeast ridge above the timberline. The summit is accessed by hiking west around the prominent rise at about 7,800 feet, and up the southwest summit pitch. Descend along the south bowl and southeast ridge. The open terrain provides some of the best backcountry tracks in the area. Below the tree line, ski out the trail. Snowboarders may want to pack some poles for the flats! </p>
