    <h3>Course Description:</h3>
    <p>On Sunday, we move east on the mountain and offer a new epic course. Racers will start at 3245ft, and drop almost 4 miles and 1000ft! This time with a long road rolling start, riders will quickly build up speed as they fly through the upper fire roads above Jacksonville.  Once the roads disappear, you will find yourself on Pair-A-Dice Trail.  This Quad trail has it's own personality that will test every riders nerve &amp; resolve as well as their bike handling skills.  As you descend down, you will find the terrain changes from smooth, to sandy, and everything in between.  Dropping into the treeline, you will be greeted again by banked turns, beautiful views, &amp; insane pleasure.  About 3/4 of the way down the trail, in true John's Peak fashion, you will find yourself surprised by the last STEEP, but very short climb.  After you re-gain the feeling in your legs, you are ready for the final stretch to the finish line inside the Pair-A-Dice unloading zone.  Sunday's event will be followed by an awards ceremony and a generous raffle. Finish times from Saturday and Sunday will be combined to determine the fastest racer on the mountain.</p>

    <p>Returning to the Registration Area after Finishing: Ride down Pair-A-Dice Road to HWY 238 (about 2 miles).  Once you reach HWY 238, turn right (up the hill), then make another right turn on Jacksonville Reservoir Road.  Pedal back up to the Registration area for the Awards Ceremony and Raffle (about 1 mile). </p>
