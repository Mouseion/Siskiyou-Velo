<h3>Course Description:</h3>
<p>Starting above the MRA's Lily Prairie at 3854ft you will be blown away as you fly down the trail almost 7 miles &amp; 2000ft! A couple of short but steep climbs will put you on some of the best trails Southern Oregon has to offer. From the starting line, riders will quickly descend down the technical MRA Lily Prairie Trail. New for this year, this 2.5 mile trail crosses the hill side with rolling climbs, banked corners &amp; high speed fun. You will cross last years start line zipping down Jumper Trail and finally tie into Boundary Trail. One short STEEP climb up Boundary followed by a 1/4 mile flat double-track that leads you to Cantrell Creek Trail. As you descend down this thickly wooded, shallow creek bed, just try to keep from smiling! Upon exiting the tree line, riders will again turn down more single-track following the road. Granite Trail offers a great mix of both technical ability as well as your ability to pedal. Following the contour of the road, you will find your self grinning the whole way down. (This also offers a great place for spectators to watch with the road being just a mere 5ft from the trail.) Near the bottom of Granite Trail, riders will cross a new bridge built with funds from last years events. Descending down Ridge View Trail and traveling up the road for a brief period you will reach Norling Creek Trail. Starting with two tight switchbacks, you will quickly find yourself at a water crossing, before heading in to a .5mi trail with a thick canopy providing dim lighting &amp; insane traction. Across the last road section and you will wind up on the Rail Trail, you will once again be hammering on your pedals driving home to the finish line located inside the Jacksonville Reservoir. Built as a true Super D, bike &amp; tire selection will come in to play for this course.</p>
