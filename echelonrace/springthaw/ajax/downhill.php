<h3>Downhill Course Description:</h3>
<p>The Downhill begins at Four Corners high in the Ashland Watershed.  The course takes place entirely on the Catwalk Trail - 1.7 miles of adrenaline rush to the bottom where it intersects with Toothpick Trail.  This course has plenty of technical sections, tight switchbacks, a couple all-out straight sections, and the last 60 yards is a slight uphill to the finish - a little bit of everything thrown in to even out the competition. You'll get plenty of practice time in and our free shuttle to get you back up to the start line.  When it's all over, kick back to a great lunch while you're waiting for the awesome prize raffle and awards to start.</p>
