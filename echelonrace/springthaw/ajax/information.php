        <li>NEW FOR THIS YEAR: The Saturday Cross Country Race venue has moved to the top of Lithia Park near the swimming reservoir. Due to city safety concerns, we have eliminated a majority of the race course that exists on open roads/streets. We just want to keep our racers as safe as possible. Same wonderful race, come help us break in the new digs!  Just find the Lithia Park bandshell and follow the signs to the top of the park.  </li>
        <li>NO BICYCLES ARE ALLOWED IN LITHIA PARK.</li>
        <li>You must wear a helmet at all times while participating in this event, even during your warm-up, our insurance requires this! Eye protection and gloves are also strongly recommended. Riders should carry their own spare tube, patch kit, tools, and water bottles. </li>
        <li>There will be a prize raffle held just after the awards are presented, on both days. All riders and volunteers are eligible to win prizes. Your raffle ticket is in your packet. Please deposit it in the correct raffle box located at the registration canopy. There is one box for the Cross Country and one for the Downhill. </li>
        <li>Extra Lunch tickets are available for non-entrants on each day for $10. Shirts are also available for sale throughout the weekend for $20. Both may be purchased at the registration canopy. A portion of the proceeds from this event goes toward local trail building and maintenance projects. </li>
        <li>Limited parking times are enforced in Lithia Park on Saturdays. Echelon Events will not cover your parking tickets. There will be limited parking on Glenview Street, just passed the swimming Reservoir: First Come First Serve. There is a large public pay lot behind the Shakespeare theater complex. </li>
        <li>Don't forget the Post Race Party at Standing Stone Brewing Company, 101 Oak Street. It's a great way to unwind and socialize after a day of hard racing. Also, downhill packet pickup and registration will be occurring there from 4:00 to 5:00pm. </li>
        <li>Please help promote responsible mountain biking by not littering on the course. </li>
        <li>The City of Ashland prohibits alcoholic beverages, bicycles and domestic animals within Lithia Park. </li>
        <li>This event is being held partly on US Forest Service land, held under USFS special use permit. Rogue River National Forest, Ashland Ranger District. Special thanks to the City of Ashland. </li>
