    <p>The 7th Annual Jacksonville Forest Park STXC returns to J&rsquo;ville this year.  Since 2006 this race has brought the local biking community together for summer evening fun.  This year, the STXC will bring you 4 different courses to test your bike handling skills.  Bring your bike, bring your cheering section, and let&rsquo;s have a good time.  Don&rsquo;t forget about the tasty summer BBQ at the last race.</p>
    <p>* Special thank you to the <a href="http://www.jacksonvilleoregon.org/">City of Jacksonville</a>, and the <a href="http://www.motorcycleridersassociation.org/">Motorcycle Riders Association</a></p>
