    <h3>Sunday July, 29</h3>
    <p>Starting just above Lilly Prairie, riders will transverse the low portion of "Lilly Prairie Trail" until they drop rapidly in to Lilly Prairie.  Turning on to the MRA's technical & flowy "Jumper" Trail down to "Boundary Trail".  A meager 300ft of climbing(at 4%) will lead riders down the newly refurbished connection trail to "Cantrell Creek" putting you back on our SHOOTOUT Super D  course.  John's Peaks legendary "Granite Trail" will bring riders back to reality with blazing speeds of up to 30mph on some of the fastest, funnest, flowing singletrack we have to offer.  As you wind down to the bottom, you will cross a bridge followed by "Naverson Family Trail" Then on to "Norling Creek"  Both trails are narrow & as fast as they get.  From there you will cross the road & turn right on to STXC trail.  This "NO BRAKES" Trail is wicked fast & super FUN!!!  After a creek crossing & short sprint to the finish, you will be begging for more!</p>
