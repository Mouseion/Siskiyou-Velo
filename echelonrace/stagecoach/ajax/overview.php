    <p>2012 brings both the Cross Country and Super D State Championships to the Rogue Valley. Come for an action packed weekend of racing and you might go home with gold.</p>
    <p>Based off the original Revenge of the Siskiyous Jacksonville course, the Stagecoach Cross Country Mountain Bike Race returns to Jacksonville for its 2nd year.</p>
    <p>After a season of XC racing, come test how tough you are.  Did all your hard work and training pay off? Our climbs are steeper and our trails are harder. Just when your legs are screaming for mercy at the top you get the privilege of blasting down the epic Bike Fest Super D course. You will not be disappointed! Come see if you have what it takes to conquer the mountain.</p>
